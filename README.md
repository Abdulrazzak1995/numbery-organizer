# Numbery Organizer

A very fun set of exercises.  You will practice:

* Using built-in array methods to filter, map & reduce
* Using `this`
* Writing methods that read and write from object data
* Working with type coercion (Strings & Numbers)
* Understanding test cases
* TDD: Test early and test often

## The Challenge

> * [./object.js](./object.js)
> * [./tests](./tests)

This exercise is meant to be studied in the browser. You will need to write the logic for an object that stores strings, sorted by Numberyness & NaNyness.  The logic to solving this exercise is all about mapping, filtering & reducing arrays. What will be new is using `this` to read and write from properties in an object instead of only working with arguments and local variables.

To complete this exercise clone this repository, open the `index.html` locally in your browser, and start coding.  Each time you make a change in the object, refresh your browser to see how you did!  Here are some ideas you can try to help debug your object:

* __Set your DevTools to pause on caught exceptions__: this will pause your debugger _before_ the error occurs so you can inspect what was in memory that caused the error.
* __Set Breakpoints in your DevTools__: In the `sources` tab of your devtools, click on the line number that is causing you trouble.  The program will pause there for you to inspect memory.
* __Use `debugger;` statements__: This is very similar to breakpoints, but written into the source code.  Breakpoints exist only in the browser you are currently using, debugger statements will pause your code anywhere.

## Practice Problems

> [github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/early-return](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/early-return)

`early-return` is a series of exercises that are very similar to the challenges in this repository, you may find it helpful to solve these before attempting the `number-organizer` exercises.

You will need to work with type coercion between numbers & strings, avoiding side-effects, and using native array methods.  The logic of these exercises is very similar to what you will need for the `numbery-organizer` but in a simpler format (pure functions instead of an object).  Taking your time to fully understand the `early-return` problems will help to solve the `numbery-organizer`.
